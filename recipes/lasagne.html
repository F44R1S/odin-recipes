<h1>Lasagne: A Good Ol' Bri'ish Dish</h1>

<img src="../images/lasagne.jpg">

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The origins of the word lasagne or lasagna can be traced back to Ancient Greece. What we know 
    as lasagne or lasagna is derived from the word “laganon”, which was the first form of pasta. 
    Laganon was a reference to flat sheets of pasta dough cut into thin strips. As you might expect, 
    Laganon looked very different from what we know to be a typical lasagna dish today. 
    It consisted of layers of pasta and sauce without traditional Italian ingredients. 
    Ancient Rome was known to have a similar dish called “lasanum”, which is Latin for container or 
    pot. Italians used this word to refer to the pot that the dish was served in. Eventually, 
    the dish evolved and took on the same name. The origins of what we know as twisted macaroni 
    came later. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>    1 onion, diced</li>
    <li>    1 carrot, diced</li>
    <li>    1 celery stalk, diced</li>
    <li>    2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
    <li>    250g beef mince</li>
    <li>    250g pork mince</li>
    <li>    1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>    400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>    200ml beef stock</li>
    <li>    200ml red wine</li>
    <li>    1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>    9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
    <li>    50g Parmesan, grated</li>
    <li>    150g pack mozzarella, shredded</li>
    <li>    50g butter</li>
    <li>    50g plain flour</li>
    <li>    550ml semi-skimmed milk</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic 
        for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. 
        Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, 
        chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or 
        until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
    <li>    Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and 
    add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and 
    gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and 
    whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>    Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, 
    starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. 
    Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot 
    and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
